# Rune Factory 3 Translator

> ⚠️ **Development was halted after the developers announced the release of a [remastered Edition]() for Nintendo Switch, which will feature more languages**

This is an android app intended for translation of the third game of the Rune Factory series.<br>
The game was initially released in Japanese and English, which is why this project should allow for more languages to be added through manipulation of the original game files. Tools like Tinke (more on [GitHub](https://github.com/pleonex/tinke) or [GBATemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/tinke-0-7-2.303529/)) can be used to extract the TEXT files from a backup of the game and replace the original files once translated.
